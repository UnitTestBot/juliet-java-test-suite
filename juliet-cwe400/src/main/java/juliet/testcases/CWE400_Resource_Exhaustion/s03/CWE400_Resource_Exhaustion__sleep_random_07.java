* CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
* BadSource: random Set count to a random value
* GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
* Sinks:
*    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as a parameter in sleep function
*    BadSink : Use count as the parameter for sleep withhout checking it's size first
* Flow Variant: 07 Control flow: if(privateFive==5) and if(privateFive!=5)
