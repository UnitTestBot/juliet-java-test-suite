 * @description
 * CWE: 369 Divide by zero
 * BadSource: random Set data to a random value between 0.0f (inclusive) and 1.0f (exclusive)
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero number (two)
 * Sinks: divide
 *    GoodSink: Check for zero before dividing
 *    BadSink : Dividing by a value that may be zero
 * Flow Variant: 68 Data flow: data passed as a member variable in the "a" class, which is used by a method in another class in the same package
